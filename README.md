# keyCodes

Users can press any key on their keyboard to view the key code, key name, and event code that corresponds to that key using this straightforward online application.

# Features
Displays the key pressed: Shows the key name you pressed.
Shows the corresponding `keyCode`: Maps the pressed key to its respective `keyCode`.
Displays `event.code`: Displays the event code associated with the key.

# How it Works
When you press a key on your keyboard, the application uses a preset set of key mappings to map the key to its associated `keyCode` and listens for the `keydown` event. After that, a user-friendly layout of the key name, its mapped key code, and the event code is displayed.
